# authentication-token-react

This is a simple react app where authentication has been implemented using **Firebase**.

_React router_ for navigation, _React context_ for managing the authentication state and `localStorage` in order to save the authentication token and the expiration time.

Also a very brief implementation of auto-logout based on the expiration time of the token.

Thank you for take a look!
